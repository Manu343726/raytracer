 * is scheduled the function will be invoked in the thread of the worker
 * that picked the job. The job is considered done if its function has been executed
 * and **all its child jobs are done too** (See `Job::finished()`).
 *
 * Users can wait for the completion of a job by calling `Engine::wait()`.
 *
 * Finally, user defined POD data can be associated to the job during its construction,
 * which is available later by calling `Job::getData()`. For non-POD data, see `jobs::closure()`.
